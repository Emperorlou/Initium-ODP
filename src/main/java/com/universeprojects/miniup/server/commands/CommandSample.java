/**
 * This is a sample command you can use as a reference for creating new commands.
 * 
 * Usage notes:
 * Make sure to pass in an argument called 'test'. It is expected to have a value of 1 or 2, but you can
 * make it have any value (or leave it out) and it will actually show what it's like when an exception is thrown
 * on the server (which is also useful).
 * 
 * Parameters:
 * 		test (optional) - Value of 1 or 2 expected. Anything else throws an exception.
